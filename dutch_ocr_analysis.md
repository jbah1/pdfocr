# Dutch OCR Analysis

## Summary

This analysis tests Tesseract with Dutch language support (`-l nld`) to determine if language configuration improves OCR accuracy for the expected ingredient content.

## Key Findings

1. **Minimal improvement**: Dutch language support provides only slight improvements
2. **Page 5 shows best results**: Up to 30% hit rate for some columns with PSM 6
3. **PSM 6 performs best**: Consistently better than PSM 11/12
4. **Overall still poor**: Hit rates remain very low (0-30%)

## Detailed Results

### Page 2
- **PSM 6**: 0-7% hit rate across columns
- **PSM 11**: 0-7% hit rate across columns
- **PSM 12**: 0-7% hit rate across columns

### Page 3
- **PSM 6**: 0-12% hit rate across columns
- **PSM 11**: 0% hit rate across columns
- **PSM 12**: 0% hit rate across columns

### Page 4
- **PSM 6**: 0-14% hit rate across columns
- **PSM 11**: 0-14% hit rate across columns
- **PSM 12**: 0-14% hit rate across columns

### Page 5
- **PSM 6**: 14-30% hit rate across columns (best performance)
- **PSM 11**: 10-23% hit rate across columns
- **PSM 12**: 10-23% hit rate across columns

## Comparison with English OCR

The Dutch OCR results show slight improvements over English-only OCR:
- Page 5 column 2: 30% (Dutch) vs 23% (English) with PSM 6
- Page 4 column 3: 14% (Dutch) vs 14% (English) with PSM 6
- Other pages show similar or slightly better results

## Issues Identified

1. **Still very low hit rates**: Even with Dutch language support, most expected content is not detected
2. **Inconsistent performance**: Some pages show no improvement with Dutch language
3. **Content mismatch**: The OCR is detecting different content than expected

## Recommendations

1. **Combine approaches**: Use Dutch language + image preprocessing + different PSM modes
2. **Test with hOCR output**: Get better structural information
3. **Analyze actual OCR output**: Understand what content is being detected vs. expected
4. **Test with different image resolutions**: Higher resolution may improve OCR accuracy

## Next Steps

1. Test with hOCR output format for better structure detection
2. Implement image preprocessing (binarization, denoising)
3. Analyze the actual words being detected to understand the mismatch
4. Test with higher resolution images

## Conclusion

Dutch language support provides some improvement but is not sufficient to achieve the desired OCR accuracy. A combination of approaches is needed to significantly improve the hit rates.
